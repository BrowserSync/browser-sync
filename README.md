BrowserSync is developed and maintained internally at <a href="http://www.wearejh.com">JH</a>, follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/browsersync">@browsersync</a> on twitter for news & updates.

##Features
1. **Scroll** - I can keep your pages in sync when scrolling.
2. **Forms** - You fill out a form in one browser, I'll copy the data to all the others.
3. **Links** - I'll watch your clicks and make all the other browsers follow you.
4. **CSS injecting** - I can even watch your CSS files & inject them when they change.
5. **Live Reload** - I can also watch files like HTML and PHP & when they change I can reload all browsers for you.
6. **Built-in Server** - Yep, I can serve static files too if you need me to (uses Connect).
7. **Use with any back-end setup** - I even have a proxy option so that I can be used with existing PHP, Rails, Python, Node or ASP.net setup.
8. **Public URL** - View your website via a URL that any internet connected device can access & maintain all BrowserSync features.
9. **Browser Stack support** - Use the all of my features when viewing your site through Browser Stack.


##When is it useful?
It's pretty useful when used with a single browser, watching a CSS file for changes & injecting it. But the real power comes when you're building responsive sites and using multiple devices/monitors because it can keep all browsers in sync & make your workflow much faster.

##Install

npm install -g browser-sync
